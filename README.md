# RSpython
Implementation of the Reed-solomon code in python.

Unit tests have been removed.

It is possible to return an error if the message could not be decoded. To do this, add an error statement in [rs.py](rs.py) at the place indicated by the comments.

A test/example file is available, run [test.py](test.py).
